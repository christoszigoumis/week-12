For this week, I decided to go back to near the beginning of the course and retry some work from week 3, since I figured it would make the most sense to start at the beginning of the course if I want to get any more sucesses.

The webmap I feel was the most impressive thing I did in this entire course because it was made from data I actually collected in the field, and as someone pursuing a career in archaeology, the most tangible thing I did. I was generally satisfied with the webmap I created weeks ago; I plotted the gravestones I studied as well as the boundry of the cemetery. The only part where I fell short was sucessfully being able to georeference a historical map onto the site of the cemetery itself. This was initally dissapoint to me because, as I had previosuly mentioned, been georeferencing aerial photos of the Mani peninsula in Greece for a few months before I started this course. Although I was doing it on ArcGIS, and I have learned that different softwares used for the same goals usually have completely different ways of doing things.

So I re-did the webmap portion of week 3, and it went far better than how it had initially. After setting up the base webmap, I tried finding any historial maps of the Navan area online, but to no avail. I wasn't too surprised at this since Navan is a fairly isolated and insignificant town in the Ottawa region, not to mention the church I was studying wasn't actually in Navan, simply just a road that leads to Navan, presumably paved into the modern Navan road we use today, so essentially the church was surrounded by farmland. Today to its west is still farmland and the Greenbelt, but its east is Orleans, a massive suburb. I then went onto a site that I like using to look at Ottawa, called geoOttawa, because it has an aerial photo feature with a slider of various years in which aerial photos were taken. The oldest aerial photo is from 1958, which isn't that old, but the landscape of the are around is completely different and attests to the agricultural purpose that this area of Ottawa once had. 

After taking a screenshot of this aerial image with the church and its immediate surroundings, I made it a png file and managed to get it into the index.html file as another layer. I also sucessfully georectified this aerial photo using Map Warper. I was then able to see the old aerial photo displayed, which was a great success for me. 

I think the main difference between reproducing and replicating something is that when something is replicated, it implies that the replication yields an identical or near-identical result. Reproducing something usually means that the final product will differ in some significant way.

With this in mind, I don't think I replicated making the webmap from week 3, but instead reproduced it. I did use the same code as provided to me, but redrew the boundry lines around the church and put in the coordinates again. I also went further with it and layered a georectified map on top of what I had done previously. If I had replicated what I did before in week 3, I would have been equally as stumped and gotten nowhere.

Replication is critical to digital archaeology because it allows us to ackownledge our shortcomings in the completion of a certain task. That is why studies and papers published in digital arhcaeology, or all of archaeology, are so significant. Another archaeolgoist could read a paper on dating Frankish towers in Attica and Boeotia, apply the same methods used by the author, and reach a different conclusion that there is not enough evidence to accurately date towers in Attica and Boeotia to the Frankish period. The academic coming to this conclusion can then question the author's biases towards the Franks, perhaps he is French and has a romantic view of the Frankish period of Greece. With respect to digital archaeology, it allows others code to be replicated, and for any errors to be found and hopefully fixed. For the public, although they understandably lack the knowledge of replicating everything in a study published, data made available can give the public a better sense of understanding when it comes to archaeological work.

My thinking has evolved quite a bit since the end of Module 2 with respect to digital archaeology and more broadly archaeology as a whole. I've learned that digital archaeology is so different from traditional archaeology that I cannot apply the same methods I normally would to fully understand what is going on in digital archaeology. I can't read Herodotus or Pausanias, or some hundred year old publication of a site by the American School of Athens, or even excavate a site. That is traditional archaeology. I think another term for digital archaeology could be post-archaeology, or meta-archaeology. Not in the sense that digital archaeology is work that can be done on computers after a site is excavated, but rather we approaching the end of traditional archaeology. So much archaeological data is made available online that it is entierly possible someone could have a whole career in digital archaeology without actually excavating a site, although I'm not sure anyone would actually want to do this.
